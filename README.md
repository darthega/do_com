# Daniel Ortega Profile site

This repository keeps track of the development of Daniel Ortega's personal web site using front end technologies to generate a full MEAN stack Single Page Application.

Bear in mind that this is a work in progress, this is the very first iteration of this read me document, so no much to say, it'll keep growing, I promise.

## Bootstraping process
So far I've made the choice to give typescript a try, so all I've done so far is install NPM's typescript module:

`npm install -g typescript`

Following the typescrit's [www.typescriptlang.org/](site) recommendation, I've installed the module as a global resource for my local environment.
